This repository contains a python application that scrapes NCAA basketball results from sports-reference.com and calculates each school's ELO rating.
The application is run by using the ncaa_elo.py script.
By default, the range of dates to be scraped is set to be the 2013-2014 regular season and conference tournaments.
These dates can be adjusted by resetting the startDate and endDate parameters in the Schedule class.
This script is designed to run using Python 2.7.
It should be able to run in other versions with slight modification.
The successful output of ncaa.py using the default settings is contained in result.txt.
